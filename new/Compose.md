Statefull and Stateless Container
Stateless Container: Data will be deleted after container get deleted
stateful Container: Data will be maintainer or save after container get deleted
Even if we deploy latest code or if we recreate a container, we should not loose our data
to maintain data permanently, we need to have a container as Stateful Container
TO make container as statefull, we need to use Docker Volume concept 
---------------------------------------
=> Docker volumes are used to persist the data which is generated by Docker Container. It is used to avoid data loss
=> We have 3 type of volume
a. Anonymous Volume (No Name)
b. Named volume
c. Bind Mounts
---------------------------------------
-> docker volume create myvolume
-> docker volume list
-> cd /var/lib
--------------------------------------
How to attach the volume to a container
docker run -it -v myvolume:/tmp ubuntu /bin/bash
to go inside the docker 
=> docker attach id
